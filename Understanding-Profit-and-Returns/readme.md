The goal of this project was to create visualizations based on profits and returns. I was provided with a CSV file with the sales records for a business and I was to use
an analytics-based approach to understand how profits and returns are impacted and why.

The first part of this project I researched was profits. I developed a tableau dashboard that allows the filtering of categories to narrow down how profits are distributed. This dashboard showed the total profit and sub-categories over time and location.

I was then tasked with examining the cause of the return rate. I measured multiple criteria to take into account returns. The first data I looked at was location to find the States with the highest return rate.
After that, I measured the product category and the month the return occurred in. I created multiple visualizations as demonstrated in my dashboard. I also added filters so the data can be examined under different criteria. In conclusion, I succeeded in isolating the States with the highest amount of returns. I also found the items that have the lowest amount of sales and the highest amount of returns.

In conclusion, I can implement this dashboard to examine each state and find items that do not sell well and have the highest number of returns. In isolating California, Utah, and Oregon, the 3 States with the largest returns, we can see that paper and binders had the highest amount of returns while having the lowest number of sales. I found that it is important to look for defects in the product and stop selling them if no defect can be addressed. 

In the future, I would like to expand this data set to look into other factors. Specifically, I would like to research how new products would impact the market.
