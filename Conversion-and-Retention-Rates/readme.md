This project utilized Google Sheets to import data regarding online behavior of customers. Conversion to sale and retention rates were viewed
through multiple tables and charts to find patterns and recommendations as to how to improve profitablity.

My first step in this project was to build a conversion funnel. Using raw_user_activity, I crated a pivot table to find conversion rates.

I then prepared the data for cohort analysis. My first step was to clean annd filter the data I was assigned. I filtered the data to find only purchases and created the sheet "purchase_activity"
I then calculated the first purchase event for each id. This was also done using a pivot table.

My final task was to calculate retention rates. I did this by grouping the data into cohorts. I then used this cohort analysis to calculate the retention rate for each cohort at each cohort age
in the table I created, based on the starting cohort sizes

In conclusion, I found that 29% of users who view the page add items to their cart, while 36% of those users complete the purchase. I also found that Retention is low,
resulting in a large loss after 1-2 weeks.


In furthur updates, I will look into other factors affecting why this retention is low. I can look into similar data sets to find factors that cause greater retention. I can also look into if users who made a specific purchase had greater or less retention than other users who made a different purchase.
