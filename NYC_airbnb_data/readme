The project task was to analyze user data and find the best suggecstion for a new airbnb in New york City. 
This was accomplished by utilizing google sheets. 
Given raw data, I organized the data into seperate sheets.
The data then underwent cleaning and organization to enable analysis.
Vlookup and pivot tables were utilized to find necessary aggregate data. 
Multiple charts were created to demonstrate the data visually.
