The project task was to analyze user data and find the best suggestion for a new Airbnb in New York City. This was accomplished by utilizing google sheets. Given raw data, I organized the data 
into separate sheets.

My first task in this project was to filter for the columns and rows that were most important for analysis. I eliminated properties that did not have a review in the past 12 months. I was also
short-term rentals so I eliminated anything with a minimum night greater than 7.

I then looked into what neighborhoods are most attractive for vacation rentals, as well as what amount of bedrooms are most sought after. I created a pivot table to calculate the most popular neighborhoods through the use of reviews. I used this information to find the average occupancy and price regarding the amount of bedrooms in each of these neighborhoods. 1 Bedrooms was the most popular amount of bedrooms by a considerable amount.

I then created a chart to find what days of the week are best for occupancy. What was found is that while Thursdays are the most popular, the distribution is relatively even.

Finally, I looked into other attributes such as wait time, having a doorman, and reviews. The only factor I researched that resulted in higher profitability was that of higher reviews.

In conclusion, I found that a 1 bedroom rental in the Lower East Side is the best possible scenario to start a new Airbnb rental. Hosts should also pay attention to their reviews but the day of the week does not have very much impact on rentals.
