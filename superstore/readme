The goal of this project was to create visualizations based on profits and returns. I was tasked with examining the cause of the return rate.
I measued multiple criteria to take into account sales and returns. The first data I looked at was location to find the States with the highest return rate.
After that, I measured product category and the month the return occured in. I created multiple visualizations as demonstrated in my dashboard. I also addd filters so the data 
can be examined under different criteria. In conclusion, I succeeded in isolatig the States with the highest amount of returns. I also found the items that have the lowest amount of sales 
and the highest amount of returns.
