This program task was to I conducted an analysis on various restaurants. My first action was to clean and organize my data set. I utilized google sheets to aggregate data and split columns to fit my purposes.
This included spliting cuisine types so each column would only show one. I used pivot tables to find the total sales and quantity of sales in each restaurant.
Once I had my data cleaned and organized, I exported my csv to tableau. From there I created a dashboard based on the criteria I was interested in exploring.
I investigated which restaurants are most popular. 
I also researched how revenue is impacted by each restaurant. I focused on both sales quantity and sales amount to find the most profitable possibilities. My main focus was on cost, cuisine, location, and rating.
I utilized a Tableau dashboard to easily display and compare restaurants based on these criteria. 
A dashboard was created to aid consumers in researching different data points.
The 4 metrics explained were put together and can be filtered down by multiple metrics. Cost, City, and both main cuisine and secondary cuisine can all be filtered to narrow down results even more depending on what is needed. 
A recommendation was formed for a new restaurant to be as profitable as possible based on the data provided.
