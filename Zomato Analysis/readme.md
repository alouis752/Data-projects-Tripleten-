This task was to analyze various restaurants. My first action was to clean and organize my data set. I utilized Google Sheets to aggregate data and split columns to fit my purposes.
This included splitting cuisine types so each column would only show one. I used pivot tables to find the total sales and quantity of sales in each restaurant.

Once I had my data cleaned and organized, I exported my CSV to Tableau. From there I created a dashboard based on the criteria I was interested in exploring. I investigated which restaurants are most popular. The first factor that was considered was location. Most of the sales were made in the northern area of the country. This is due to many cities in a relatively small area so sales are naturally higher. The high-sales cities are concentrated around Delhi. Of this area, Sirsa was the highest profitable city. Outside of this area, the highest sales were in Tirupati.

The second factor that was considered was the rating. The rating was measured against sales quantity to find how rating impacts how many sales occurred. The data showed that rating did not have an impact on sales quantity. As shown in the chart below, most sales occurred with no review. If we take the results with no ratings out, we still have the highest numbers around 3.8 - 4.2 rather than higher numbers being shown in the 5 range.

The next factor that was considered was cuisine. Different cuisine was explored as to how it drove possible business and resulted in more sales. The cuisine types were filtered into the top 10. Having a secondary cuisine was also considered as many restaurants offer multiple options for customers. Below are the top 10 cuisine choices in a colored chart to show how much of them have a secondary cuisine. The biggest result was a main cuisine of Indian or North Indian and a secondary cuisine of Chinese.

The last factor that was measured was cost. Using a treemap, cost was measured against sales quantity and sales total. ₹200 was the most popular cost and ₹300 and ₹250 were almost as popular. This lends itself to the result that the cheapest option is not the most popular.

I utilized a Tableau dashboard to easily display and compare restaurants based on these criteria. 
A dashboard was created to aid consumers in researching different data points.
The 4 metrics explained were put together and can be filtered down by multiple metrics. Cost, City, and both main cuisine and secondary cuisine can all be filtered to narrow down results even more depending on what is needed.

In conclusion, the data has shown that the best recommendation for a new business to be successful would be to open a mainly Indian restaurant that also serves Chinese food. This business should focus on serving the area around Sirsa to be the most profitable. They should also aim to keep cost to between ₹200 and ₹300 to attract the most customers. Ratings are not a large factor but having a rating of 4 or above would drive slightly more customers. 


In the future I would like to narrow down the dashboard farther. I would like to research if different cuisines are prefered in differennt parts of the country.
